# Build a search ( -as-you-type ) feature.

Consider you have a database with a massive number of entries ( 100million+ ) from which you got a tiny portion in `clients.json`. Build a web-app which provides search functionality for the data.

A user would want to search for the first + last name and/or the country of origin.

## Requirements:

- The front end must get the data via Graphql from the backend.
- A user sees max 10 items at a given time.
- Use node.js + react.
- Have it "search as you type".
- The css needs to be responsive and work at a minimum in IE11.
- Test your (react) components with jest.
- See this app as the foundation of a much larger project with a lot more features to come.

## Bonus

- Autocomplete
- Flowtype
- Whatever else you can dream up.

In general, use as little external libraries you deem neccessary.

For Philipp: Make a plan, where are potential issues, how long will it take to create this?
